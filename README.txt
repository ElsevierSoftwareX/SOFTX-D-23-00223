# JGMP
Java bindings for the GMP Library.

The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) is a widely used
library for computing with arbitrary precision arithmetic. The library has
bindings for many programming languages, including .NET, OCaml, Perl,
PHP, Python, R, Ruby, and Rust, with the notable exception of Java.

The JGMP library provides Java bindings and wrappers for using GMP from
within any JVM-based language.

A set of benchmarks and examples is available in JGMPBenchmarks
