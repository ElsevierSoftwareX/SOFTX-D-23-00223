        JGMP is a set of Java bindings and wrappers for the <a href="https://gmplib.org/" target="_blank">GMP</a>
        (GNU Multi Precision Arithmetic Library) written using the <a href="https://github.com/java-native-access/jna"
            target="_blank">JNA</a> (Java Native Acccess) library.
    </p>
    <p>
        The JGMP library consists of two packages. The {@link it.unich.jgmp.nativelib} package contains the low level
        code directly interfacing with the native GMP library, while the {@link it.unich.jgmp} package contains the
        high level classes which wrap native code.
    </p>
    <p>
        It should work with all GMP versions from 5.1.0 onward. Although some care has been devoted to make the bindings
        work in different systems, it has been tested so far only on 64 bit Linux with GMP 6.2.1.
