        JGMP is a set of Java bindings for the <a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a>
        (GNU Multi Precision Arithmetic Library) written using the <a
            href="https://github.com/java-native-access/jna">JNA</a> (Java Native Acccess) library.
    </p>
    <p>
        The library consists of two packages. The {@link it.unich.jgmp.nativelib} package contains the low level
        code directly interfacing with the native GMP library, while the {@link it.unich.jgmp} package containes the
        high level
        classes which wrap native code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although some care has been devoted to make the bindings work in different systems, it has been only tested
        on 64 bit Linux with GMP 6.2.1.
