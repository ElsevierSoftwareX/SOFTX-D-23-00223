        JGMP is a set of Java bindings and wrappers for the <a href="https://gmplib.org/" target="_blank">GMP</a>
        (GNU Multi Precision Arithmetic Library) written using the <a href="https://github.com/java-native-access/jna"
            target="_blank">JNA</a> (Java Native Acccess) library.
    </p>
    <p>
        The JGMP library consists of two packages. The {@link it.unich.jgmp.nativelib} package contains the low level
        code directly interfacing with the native GMP library, while the {@link it.unich.jgmp} package contains the
        high level classes which wrap native code.
    </p>
    <p>
        It should work with all GMP versions from 5.1.0 onward.
        The JGMP library has been tested on Linux, Windows 10 and mac OS (on the x86-64 architecture) with GMP 6.2.1.
