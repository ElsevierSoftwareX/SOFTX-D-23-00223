        JGMP is a set of Java bindings and wrappers for the <a href="https://gmplib.org/" target="_blank">GMP</a>
        (GNU Multi Precision Arithmetic Library) written using the <a href="https://github.com/java-native-access/jna"
            target="_blank">JNA</a> (Java Native Acccess) library.
    </p>
    <p>
        The JGMP library consists of two packages. The {@link it.unich.jgmp.nativelib} package contains the low level
        code directly interfacing with the native GMP library, while the {@link it.unich.jgmp} package contains the
        high level classes which wrap native code.
    </p>
    <p>
        It should work with all GMP versions from 6.1.0 onward.
        The JGMP library has been tested on Linux, Windows 10 and mac OS (on the x86-64 architecture) with GMP 6.2.1.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before working with JGMP you need to install the native GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library
        <a href="https://gmplib.org/" target="_blank">GMP</a>. The native library is loaded by a static class
        initializer using the
        <a href="https://java-native-access.github.io/jna/5.13.0/javadoc/com/sun/jna/NativeLibrary.html"
            target="_blank">NativeLibrary</a>.getInstance
        method of JNA, and it must be placed in a path where it is discoverable.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Linux and macOS you may generally install GMP with your preferite package manager. In Windows you can put the
        <code>gmp.dll</code> file directly in the main folder of the application using JGMP.
